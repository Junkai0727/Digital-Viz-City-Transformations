# Digital-Viz-City-Transformations

Hello! welcome to Group 9 playground (CASA0003 Digital-Viz).

This project is developed by [@Franklin Fang](https://github.com/fang-zeqiang), [@Grace Lyu](https://github.com/gracexxi), [@Junkai](https://github.com/Junkai0727), [@Mengqing Zhao](https://github.com/MengqingZhao)

We hope to tell a story about Cycling in Toronto ( What has city of Toronto done to improve the urban cycling experience? )

There are several sub-topics (sub-stories) for our digital visualisation project.

1. Bicycle Thefts (Threat & Opportunity)
2. Parking Capacity (Change & Improvement)
3. Cycling Commute Time (Evolution)
